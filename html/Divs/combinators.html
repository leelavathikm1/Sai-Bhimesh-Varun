    <!-- A combinator is something that explains the relationship between the selectors.
        A CSS selector can contain more than one simple selector. Between the simple selectors, we can include a combinator.
        There are four different combinators in CSS:

        descendant selector (space)
        child selector (>)
        adjacent sibling selector (+)
        general sibling selector (~) -->
        
    <h2>Descendant Selector</h2>
    <p>The descendant selector matches all elements that are descendants of a specified element.</p>

<div>
  <p>Paragraph 1 in the div.</p>
  <p>Paragraph 2 in the div.</p>
  <section><p>Paragraph 3 in the div.</p></section>
</div>

<p>Paragraph 4. Not in a div.</p>
<p>Paragraph 5. Not in a div.</p>

<h2>Adjacent Sibling Selector</h2>

<p>The + selector is used to select an element that is directly after another specific element.</p>
<p>The following example selects the first p element that are placed immediately after div elements:</p>

<div>
  <p>Paragraph 1 in the div.</p>
  <p>Paragraph 2 in the div.</p>
</div>

<p>Paragraph 3. After a div.</p>
<p>Paragraph 4. After a div.</p>

<div>
  <p>Paragraph 5 in the div.</p>
  <p>Paragraph 6 in the div.</p>
</div>

<p>Paragraph 7. After a div.</p>
<p>Paragraph 8. After a div.</p>
</body>
